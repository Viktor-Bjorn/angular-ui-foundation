# [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) Directives for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress.

Provides directives specific for using Foundation with Angular JS. To setup on your system:

  - `git clone git@github.com:mhayes/angular-ui-foundation.git`
  - Open `misc/index.html` in your browser
  - Foundation directives can be found in `src/ui-foundation.js`

## TODO

### `ui.foundation.utils`

  - `containerSize` needs to accept `w` and `h` parameters to selectively set just width or height
  - `containerSize` needs to have a mechanism to force it to recompute the container height/width
